# UndeleteTwitter

This bot will loop over everyone specified in a "tracking" database and log all their
tweets we have access to. If one of those tweets ever disappears from their timeline we
 will know about it and we can let everyone know about it.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
```
